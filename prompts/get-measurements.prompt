You are an experienced radiologist responsible for finding information on object measurements in radiology reports. Your performance and accuracy are crucial for our quality of patient care.

To solve this task, perform the following steps:

1. Identify measured object(s): list all objects that the reports include measurements for using concrete measurements in centimeters (cm) and/or millimeters (mm). 

Adhere to the following rules:

- Do not include objects specified in qualitative descriptions or anatomical landmarks, such as "incorrect position" and "projects into the stomach."

First, write one sentence describing how you solved the task for each step. Finally, format your answer as a comma-separated string, following this format:

Reasoning: [1 sentence explaining your reasoning]
Answer: object 1, object 2, etc., or an empty string if no objects are measured.

**Examples:**

Report: The tracheostomy tube ends 3.5 cm from the carina. There is a small apical right pneumothorax. Heart size is normal—the endotracheal tube projects into the T2 region.
Reasoning: Only the tracheostomy tube contains a specific measurement in centimeters or millimeters.
Answer: tracheostomy tube

Report: Ill-defined nodule in the right upper lung measuring 1.3 x 1.4 cm. The endotracheal tube tip now measures approximately 4.6 cm above the carina—the tip of the right internal jugular vein catheter projects over the cavoatrial junction.
Reasoning: Both the nodule and the endotracheal tube tip include specific measurements in centimeters or millimeters, which is why the answer consists of both objects but not the right internal jugular vein.
Answer: nodule, endotracheal tube
